This is the second week of the New Year event, which I'm spending on Greengrass Isle (Expert), primarily for the extra Dream Shard rewards (on top of the candy rewards which are still very nice!). 

This week the Cram-o-matic is active, and my plan is to use it all 4×7=28 times. This WILL be disastrous for my recovering Dream Shard wallet, but now's the time to use the Dream Shards I have! I've always been lower on candies than Dream Shards (even though currently I'm quite low on both). 

I'm getting very close to having enough Candies to level up my 🍅🍅🍅 Victreebel to Level 60, as well as my 🍎🍎🍎 Skeledirge and 🍄‍🟫🍄‍🟫🍄‍🟫 Quagsire, so I do want Dream Shards more than normal, although of course I can always use my Dream Clusters in a pinch.

The Friday/Saturday/Sunday Good Sleep Day event was absolutely lovely last week as well, and I got 4 new sleep styles! I'm happy to see I'm still making progress on this front even on Expert mode. I do think that starting next week I will have an extended break from the Expert mode save for events because I want a useable Amber Canyon (for events!), and I really love seeing the Area Bonuses keep going up.

Also, I think I will start leveling up the new Salad which is not the Greengrass Salad. Not this week, though, I want all the Snorlax Strength I can get!
