Now that I've done all this work on the plotting library, I think it's time to start working towards using what I've written thus far. I've brought in some code I wrote a while ago to pull from the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL)'s [undocumented API](https://github.com/IsabelleLefebvre97/PWHL-Data-Reference), and to parse this data into [pandas DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). I'm using the [requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to access the API, and I've cordoned off the API calling into its own script, `pwhl_api.py`.

In particular I collect two JSONs, which I call `schedule.json` and `teams.json`. The `schedule.json` file contains each game played in the 2025-26 season, and `teams.json` collects the participating teams.

With the schedule, I figure out for each game:
- The two participating teams
- The points earned by each team towards the league standings

This is all the data which will be used in the plot, for now.
