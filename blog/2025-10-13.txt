<h2>New navbar!</h2>
<h5>2025-10-13</h5>
<p>I've changed how the navbar works, using CSS I figured out over a few hours. It's supposed to look like a subway map :) I found <a href="https://dev.to/peterc/how-to-create-joined-bulletpoint-lists-with-css-bbc-news-style-1eem">this post</a> to be helpful for joining the dots/stations.</p>
<p>It's very tenuously held together and I really wish I could make it more robust. I do want to come back to it, since I
don't think the labels are quite centered like I want them to be, and maybe I want the dots to be themselves clickable, and also change in size (or other facet of appearance) depending on what page I'm on.</p>
<p>Also I added one of my tools to the new Tools section; a simple Mario Kart World timesheet. I might yet rename this section, but I don't know what to call it.</p>
