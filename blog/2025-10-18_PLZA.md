It's Saturday today, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A released on Thursday. I'm very excited for this game, I'm really enjoying it so far, and I plan on playing it much more this weekend. I thought I'd start a little blog/diary about my playthrough, just 'cause I want to.

I played Pokemon Y as a kid, getting it for Christmas and loading up Marilland was so fun, so I'm looking forward to some nostalgia :) 

### Character customization

The game starts with a detailed character customization screen, which I thought was really nice. We can't change our hairstyle or outfit yet but knowing the Pokemon games there will be plenty of time to do so.

One choice I really appreciate in this menu are the "beauty spots", from which you can choose two placements out of a predefined selection. I've got quite a few birthmarks on my face and I do like to see them represented. 

I also love giving my avatars olive-green hair, even if I don't see myself dyeing my hair that colour (never say never). I think if I were gonna dye my hair (again), it'd be dark blue (again).

Anyways, here's my avatar!

### I'm a Tourist

Okay, character customization done, now it's time to play! Upon gaining consciousness, we're taking a train trip to Gare de Lumiose, and our bag rustles mysteriously. We step off the train, get introduced to some of the controls, and head out into the city. We get instantly clocked as a tourist and start a cutscene, where we get introduced to Urbain, as well as the ominous-sounding Quasartico Inc. When we look back down from the ad, we find our bag was stolen by a Pancham!

Speaking of our bag, it feels like everyone in this city's roasting my bag. What's wrong with my bag?? Anyways, we do have to get it back. We chase around the Pancham until we find the people apparently responsible, and suddenly they're challenging us to a battle! It's now time for me us to choose a starter. For Trice and I the choice was easy: Welcome back from HeartGold, **Niamh the Chikorita**!

We learn an entirely new way to battle, easily defeating the Pancham, and get our bag back! But now, it's nighttime, and we're in a "Battle Zone". We're not ready for this! Urbain and us try escape the Battle Zone... we battle past one poor trainer, and then when we're about to reach the safe area we get cornered by a group of three who look like they're about to challenge us. Right then, an Eternal Floette appears and uses Light of Ruin to save us! What a hero.

We make it to Hotel Z, meet AZ the owner, and head up to our room to rest. Just kidding, one more cutscene with Urbain on the roof! Okay, now it's time to rest.

### Becoming a Trainer

When we wake up (and I think the lights are all on), we go downstairs and Urbain gets me to join the Z-A Royale. I get an email with a downloadable app, which obviously I immediately install because that's very safe and something we should teach kids to do. We join "Team MZ", whatever that is, and get a sweet jacket! We also meet Lida, and now it's time to go outside.

Outside we get the tutorial for climbing ladders and jumping off rooftops, because that's very safe and something we should teach kids to do, and we head to the Pokemon Center. It was pretty shocking to see that there's no separate individual to act as the Poke Mart, it's just Nurse Joy now!

We head to the Wild Zone and learn about catching Pokemon, a very similar system to Pokemon Legends: Arceus, except I think in that game you couldn't defeat a Pokemon in battle and then catch it. I think with the way this game treats battles, being far less turn-based, that system wouldn't work, and this system feels a lot more integrated into the flow of the game.

Now, to claim our reward we go to the Pokemon Lab, and... what are you doing here!? Mable, from the evil Team Flare, is the acting director? And did Professor Sycamore retire? That's not something our player character knows, of course, but as a Pokemon fan I'm certainly suspicious... She's even got the Team Flare logo on some of her stuff!

It seems it's finally time to gain our (relative) independence as a Trainer! We meet Naveen and his Scraggy (SCRAGGY'S IN THIS GAME YESSSSS) and learn he embroidered the Team MZ logo on our jacket, and learn about using field moves like Rock Smash.

Okay, cool. Time to go explore Lumiose!

### In and Around Wild Zone 1

Now, back to Wild Zone 1. We've already caught Fletchling, Bunnelby, Scatterbug, Mareep, and Weedle for the tutorial mission. Exploring a bit we also find Pidgey, Pichu, Flabébé, Kakuna and Abra. Time to catch all of these! It seems different Pokemon have different behaviours, just like in Legends: Arceus, in particular, Pichu and Abra run away, which make them rather trickier to catch.

Now's a good time to add another Pokemon to our team: and who better to bring back than **Máire the Mareep**, also from the HeartGold playthrough? I don't think all of my team's names are gonna be Irish, but we'll figure it out as we go along.

While running around Wild Zone 1, we see our very first **shiny Pokemon**! I went and looked up the odds and the base rate is 1/4096, so that's very fortunate! We got a shiny **Fletchling**, in a nice warm yellow tint.

There's one more thing I wanted to mention: While running around I noticed the south gate of Lumiose, which is the first entrance to Lumiose we use in the Generation 6 games! That was a big hit of nostalgia for me.

Satisfied with our exploration in the limited space we have available, we head back to Hotel Z and talk to Urbain. Looks like we got a promotion match!
