I have Covid, and it's Sunday, so I have had the urge to figure some stuff out about the site. What I've done is
reorganized my files around a little bit: I'm now serving from the `public` folder rather than the root folder; this has necessitated me to figure out how to "deploy" using GitHub Actions. My partner helped a whole lot with that.

Another thing my partner helped me a whole lot with was figuring out what I've been wanting, that is, templating. I'm gonna try using [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) in Python.

Other than that, I've added a table to the Reading section and added a new section, "Games", which will have some game-specific diaries. Maybe I'll integrate those posts as general blog posts and have a way to sort through them in an organized way. That's looking a lot more approachable today than it did yesterday.
