Last week was very successful! I used Candy Boost on all my Pokemon that needed some candy help, and got them to Level 50. I ended up using 2,245,410 Dream Shards, and 1,852 candies, along with 51 Dream Cluster S. Maybe I could have also used some on Victreebel and Skeledirge, since they were both around 20-50 Handy Candies away, but I thought I'd still keep the clusters for some reason. Level 70 here we come??

I'm at Greengrass Isle (Expert) for the first week of the New Year's event, and I might still stay here next week as well. I'll save my miserable Amber Canyon weeks for after the events are over, and use the nice bonuses we get on Expert. I'm coming up pretty quickly to the Area Bonus limit on this expert island, actually, which I'm not really complaining about, but it might soon be time to abandon it for a little while.
