My next task I'm going to take on is to add **axis breaks** as well as **ticks** and **tick labels**. Today, however, I've been more occupied with documenting my code better (on top of even more modularization). I've added type-checking to all my functions, as well as docstrings to many of them. I'm still not great at writing docstrings but I have to remember that things which are blatantly obvious now, won't be in the future!

I've also installed the Black Formatter on VS Code, which hopefully will make it easier to maintain a consistent style throughout my code.
