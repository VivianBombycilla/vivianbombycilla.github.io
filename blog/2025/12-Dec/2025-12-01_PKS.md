I've made a little mistake last week, in that I haven't bought any more expert tickets, so I'll only get to go expert mode 4 times in December. That means I'll have to spend a week away from expert mode if I want to spend the week of December 29 on GG-EX, which is a real possibility.

This week, there's a cooking event, and a new arrival in **Spiritomb**! I considered getting Master 20 on Cyan Beach, or getting Master 18 on Snowdrop Tundra, but I have instead come back to Greengrass Isle (Expert) since Spiritomb can't be found in Cyan Beach, and I don't need to reach Master 18 on Snowdrop quite yet.

Then again, I could have just gone Snowdrop and saved the Expert Ticket for later in the month. On the other hand, the extra Snorlax strength this week will help me get a whole lot of Dream Shards, which hopefully will help counteract the Mini Candy Boost usage this week. (Oh yeah, Mini Candy Boost is finally back!)
