This was the first week in quite a while without any new sleep styles, indeed since Week 38 of 2025 (spent at GG-EX). No matter: That's how it goes sometimes, especially when raising the Area Bonus of weaker islands. 

I leveled up my 🥛🥛🥛 Blastoise to level 60 which took a lot of Dream Shards. The Candy Boost functionality was announced for next week, the Holiday event, so maybe that was slightly imprecise timing, although I'm really grateful to have the extra milk production now.

Speaking of the Candy Boost, I think I'll use it to bring as many of my Pokemon up to Level 50 (or thereabouts) as I can: That seems to be the big cutoff, the big cliff beyond which the Dream Shard cost becomes untenable.

In the meanwhile, I'm back on Expert mode for the nice Dream Shard rewards.
