So, that's another week without new sleep styles. That'll change this week with the introduction of Togedemaru as well as Holiday Spheal.

For the Holiday Event I'm at Greengrass Isle (Expert), since the event's at both Greengrass Isle locations, and I think I'll be able to make use of the powerful Expert mode Dream Shard rewards. 

The once-a-year Mini Candy Boost functionality is live! I've got myself a nice spreadsheet where I automatically calculate leveling costs, so I'll be able to make good use of this event to help boost my lower level Pokemon. Today, everyone's getting to Level 40.
