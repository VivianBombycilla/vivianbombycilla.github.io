I just got the website up on Github Pages! To be quite honest I want to change my Github account name but I shan't do that until I get a job, since my Github has started appearing in my resume and stuff. But for now, it's live on [vivianbombycilla.github.io](https://vivianbombycilla.github.io).

Also I managed to bring on a custom font, namely [Alegreya Sans](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht) from Huerta Typographia, which I really like.
