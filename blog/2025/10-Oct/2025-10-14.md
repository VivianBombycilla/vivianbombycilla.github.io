So I've worked on the navbar a little more: Specifically, I replaced the bullet point with an SVG, so that the spacing is better. Along the way, I found that the navbar I was working on was showing up differently between Firefox and Chrome. It turned out okay, and pretty easy to pinpoint: The `list-style-image` attribute was giving slightly different default spacing values, which I did not want to deal with. Thankfully, I was also considering just modifying the `content` attribute of the `list::marker` elements, and this gave consistent spacing between browsers (Firefox and Chrome, at least).

What else? I've also changed the spacing a little: I added a `max-width` value so the content stays in a narrow enough column in the middle to remain easy enough to read on different devices. I guess thinking about different browser experiences is a theme here.

I'm gonna go read a book now. :)
