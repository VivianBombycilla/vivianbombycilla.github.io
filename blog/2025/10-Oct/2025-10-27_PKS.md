It's Halloween week!!! I can't wait to get an Eevee with a new hat :3 Also I got a super cute shiny Munna :3

I'm looking forward to this event, it looks really fun, even if there's not much I have to do. I'm really hoping I get both Halloween Eevee styles, but I don't think I'll have any issue getting that. This also feels like it's gonna be the last week on Expert Mode Greengrass for a while, because Amber Canyon's releasing next Thursday, and so that plus the Amber Canyon Debut event means I can spend 3 straight weeks increasing the new island's AB.

### This week

Event(s): Halloween 2025
