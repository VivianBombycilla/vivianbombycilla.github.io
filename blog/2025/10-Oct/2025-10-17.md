Just a quick update since I have some thoughts but not much time.

In the last blog post I said I wanted to implement a better system to detect new blog posts: I've done that now, at least the makings of it. Each blog post is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter, and this is quite powerful so I'm using that to filter the posts into the various categories.

Maybe I could have the blog folder as an Obsidian vault, and edit my blog posts (and crucially the YAML) there. Being a big Obsidian user I do enjoy the YAML editing and the tools based on that.
