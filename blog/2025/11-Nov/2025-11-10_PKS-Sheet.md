I made a lightweight spreadsheet to track which Sleep Styles I've yet to see in Pokemon Sleep. I'm pretty proud of it, I think it looks pretty nice.

On `Input_Styles`, you tick all of the Sleep Styles you've seen, and on `Output_Unseen`, you get to see your unseen Sleep Styles, categorized by island, and sorted in reverse order by Drowsy Power Requirement (DPR). DPR is essentially a shorthand for rarity, and correlates strongly with the Snorlax Rating requirements, so sorting by this is often more illustrative of which Pokemon you're likely to see.
