This was the first week in a good long while that the choice of island has been difficult. I could either choose to start increasing my Area Bonus in some of the main islands, or, instead, to increase my Area Bonus (technically Expert Bonus) on Greengrass Isle (Expert). I've chosen the latter, because the holiday season is quickly approaching, and I want some good Dream Shards for any Mini Candy Boost or Candy Boost events which might happen.

This week is Salads week, which means I'll have the opportunity to cook my few remaining dishes and once again achieve 100% Notes completion!
