This week, Amber Canyon is set to release (on Thursday), so I'm going to be at Taupe Hollow all week and switch to Amber Canyon when I wake up in the morning for the Area Bonus boost. I'm still not sure whether we'll get an Area Bonus boost across the board: That would track with all previous [Sleep Style Goals](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/info/progress), but it also feels a bit like this cannot keep rising forever. I guess what they *can* do is increase the power of the beginner bonuses, which give extra AB% per week until a given point, so we're slowly getting more powerful, but at the same time not getting out of reach to new players as quickly.

**Thursday update:** Amber Canyon's out, and we did in fact get the increased maximum Area Bonus (up to a max of 85%), as well as pot expansions (up to a max of 81).

The pot expansions in particular are pretty shocking, since **"Flower Gift" Macarons** are now technically spammable (at 77), and that's a significant upgrade from my current Desserts/Drinks spamming option of **"Mold Breaker" Corn Tiramisu**, and I think it might even be possible to spam it sooner rather than later using my Clodsire and soon-to-be Blissey. On the other hand, **Greengrass Salads** still seem the most reliable Salad option (maybe **"Petal Blizzard" Layered Salads** could supplant it?), and I'm not sure I have what it takes to spam either **"Role Play" Pumpkaboo Stew**, 25 Mushrooms is a lot for my Level 60 BFS Gengar, but perhaps I'll have enough candies to raise both my Clodsire and Quagsire to Level 60. This would replace my current plan of rotating **Ninja Curry** and **"Dream Eater" Butter Curry**.
