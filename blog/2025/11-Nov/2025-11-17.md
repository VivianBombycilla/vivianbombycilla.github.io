I've managed to change the way I'm making the blog post pages so that there are more navbars to navigate between posts. If you're on a post about coding this website, for example, you can jump to the previous (or next) post about this website (should they exist), and you can jump to the previous or next blog post in general.

I also did some housekeeping on the YAML, improving the way I'm naming things a little, as well as some housekeeping on where I'm storing all the files for the blog posts. 

Now, the pages with lots of navbars are starting to look cluttered up top, so I'm gonna want to add an option to hide or show these elements on a click. This is not something I know how to do yet! So I'm gonna try and figure it out.
