It's the second week of the Amber Canyon Debut event, and I'm back at Amber Canyon to keep looking for new sleep styles! I got a 🥑🥑🥑 Trapinch last week, although it's EXP up and Ingredients Down so I'll have to mint it, once I get the change to level it to 60. It's also Curries and Stews week for me, so I'll try and get the new dishes on the board.

I'm at Amber Canyon instead of Greengrass despite the fact I'm not gonna get to Master 1 let alone Master 3, for the incense rewards, but I'll be able to get to Master 3 soon enough as the Area Bonus stacks and I'm not particularly fussed about getting a Bagon incense.
