### The Best Letter (No Bias)

Our next Promotion Match is against Rintaro in Restaurant Le Nah, for Rank V, which is definitely the best letter and I won't hear otherwise. The battle itself is the biggest challenge of a Promotion Match we've had so far: Rintaro uses a Simi-trio, each of which uses Protect to good effect, and which are a decent level relative to us. M치ire faints during the fight, but Fiona and Niamh manage to bring home the victory!

As is routine now, we get a story event right after we rank up. Leaving the restaurant, we see a dog Pokemon, which Emma tells us is Zygarde in its 10% Forme! AZ himself mentioned a Zygarde Cell earlier too, maybe this is related? Anyways, we follow the Pokemon around for a while, to let Emma catch up to us. But just before Emma reaches us, Zygarde takes us to a rooftop! Up here, there's an Absol, with some ominous purple energy around it. We learn from Emma that this is a Pokemon undergoing Rogue Mega Evolution, and AZ (who's also shown up) sends up a Mega Ring and his Lucario. 

We thus learn how to fight Rogue Megas, using attacks and Mega Evolving our Lucario. It's a long, intense fight, and we get hit a few times, but we eventually take down the Mega Absol, and collect the **Absolite**, which we will now use to Mega Evolve Absol (using the power of friendship this time!). **Absol** also decides to join us, which is so sweet! We'll name her **Ambrosia**.

### New Wild Zones
The next morning we learn that there are 4 new Wild Zones around Lumiose. Gosh, that must be inconvenient for people! We also battle Urbain using our newfound Mega Evolution abilities; and learn that Mega Absol's really frail but really powerful. A true glass cannon! 

With these new Wild Zones brings new Pokemon to catch, and more strong Alphas to be afraid of. So many times while exploring, I'll climb a ladder to a roof and there's a really strong Alpha Pokemon (or two) there to avoid! The Pokemon in these Wild Zones are also getting harder to catch: Mawile and Gible were a couple that gave us some grief.

Oh yeah, and it's time to add our fifth member of our team, one that I've been meaning to catch since we caught a glimpse of it: **Arthur the Slowpoke**! 

### A Meeting With Vinnie
Urbain and I have been called over to the Quasartico building up in Magenta Sector, to have a chat with Vinnie. He's really scary, and he wants to talk about how we dealt with the Rogue Mega Pokemon last night... But as it turns out, he's actually pretty chill about it! Apparently the Z-A Royale is part of Quasartico's plan to find useful trainers to control Rogue Mega Evolutions around the city, and Vinnie wants to accelerate our access to the tools given to high-ranked Trainers. As such, we're to have a Promotion Match with Vinnie (Rank: ???) for a chance at reaching Rank F!

For this important battle, we'd better prepare. The new wild Pokemon and the Trainers in Battle Zones having higher levels means that our team's getting quite a bit of experience: Enough to have **M치ire** evolve into **Ampharos**, **Niamh** evolve into **Meganium**, and **Fiona** evolve into **Talonflame**! We also revamp some of our Pokemon's moves: By reaching Level 24 in Mable's Research, we get the TM for Thunderbolt, which is a far better move than the Thunder Shock that M치ire's been running this whole time. We get Leaf Blade for Niamh, Brave Bird for Fiona, and Power Gem and Flash Cannon also for M치ire. It's a shame, however, that we don't have any Mega Stones in the Stone Emporium for any of our team... Maybe we'll have to take on some more Rogue Megas to get them.

With our team, mostly fully evolved and with stronger moves, it's time to take on Vinnie! We take down his first few Pokemon, Houndoom and Sharpedo, then run into his... Buneary? This cute Pokemon actually packed a punch, taking a lot of HP from Arthur and Fiona using Brutal Swing, but we take it down and reach his Drampa.

Sorry, Mega Drampa! This is the first new Mega I've seen and it's a beauty, I love how it reminds us of mythical Chinese dragons, even more than Drampa already does! Ambrosia's powerful Night Slash is too much for the cool new Normal/Dragon-type Mega and we get promoted to Rank F!
