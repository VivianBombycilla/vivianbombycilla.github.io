As I add more of my stuff to this blog, and as I write more stuff to this blog, I'm now questioning the wiseness of having all of the content on one page. The games section of the blog in particular is getting relatively larger (it's just 20KB but also loads in some images), so I think I want to silo everything into their own pages.

I've managed to automatically create a new page for each blog post now, it did take some effort, of course, but I'm decently happy with the result so far. It's absolutely, absolutely a work in progress, for example, there's no way to jump to the next or previous blog posts, and this is definitely a crucial step in the plan I don't want to miss out. As a result, all the content is still on these main pages.

Also, the navbar looks weird on Safari on my iPhone, so that's gotta get fixed. I should make a running to-do list for this, that's maybe beyond what I just write down here.
