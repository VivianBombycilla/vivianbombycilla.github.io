### Back to the Battle Zone

It turns out we need to collect some Ticket Points in order to earn ourselves a Challenger's Ticket, so we can take on Zach for a chance at a new rank. To get these Ticket points, we're gonna have to go back to the Battle Zone, intentionally this time, and win some battles.

Urbain, Lida, and Naveen help us out on our first night out with tips and healing. The very first battle comes as a shock: Just as we turn the corner we get spotted by some Trainer and we get stunned! Luckily, Máire and Niamh were there, and appropriately levelled, so we easily took down our first opponent and collect some points.

The next two trainers are easier: We learn about sneaking up on people (and getting snuck up on), and using this to our advantage we can get a free turn at the start of the battle. Thunder Shock from Máire and Leafage from Niamh are decent damage for our first night, and Máire's Thunder Wave is fun to hit. I also taught Máire Protect, which is a blocking move, but I'm not very good at using it yet. It seems the blocking stance doesn't last very long, but it comes out very quickly, so we can react to some of our opponent's moves in time. On the other hand, moves like Quick Attack happen too quickly to react to.

Well, great, we've got the Ticket Points we needed, and so we get our Challenger's Ticket. There's one more trainer through the hallway, with a Pidgeotto... maybe we could have a gander? It's a Rank X trainer, that's two more than I am, but I can't see what level the Pidgeotto is, so I give it a go.

It turns out, our opponent is way stronger than us! The Pidgeotto easily tears through all 6 of our Pokemon, and we black out. Thankfully, we keep our Challenger's Ticket, but as we leave the Battle Zone we earn our prize money, and I think this may have been affected. Dang it!

###  Le Z Eternel

Well, great. After that embarrassing and avoidable loss, it's time to face off against Zach for our promotion match! We track him down to the taxi parking lot, heal our Pokemon, and take him on!

As it turns out, he's not much of a challenge. After we defeat him, we learn that we're his 100th promotion match loss in a row. Maybe beating him isn't such a rare feat, but the fact is: We just got promoted to Rank Y!

Now that we're done with the rank-up, we meet Emma the detective, and then head back to Hotel Z to have dinner with Team MZ. Time for some well-earned rest!

### Quick Trip Through Lumiose

When we wake up and head downstairs, Urbain wants to take us to see Prism Tower, massive building in the middle of the city. Upon leaving Hotel Z, we also meet Tarragon from DYN4MO, from whom we get a Red Canari Plush and learn about Colorful Screws.

We learn how to climb around rooftops some more, pass by Wild Zone 2, and meet up with Urbain at the Nouveau Café (which is suspiciously Team-Flame themed!). We meet Vinnie, who works at Quasartico, and then head north towards Emma's detective agency.

Along the way, we get access to Wild Zone 3, within which we find Skiddo, Litleo, Espurr, Flabébé, and Pikachu. Urbain also sucked us into a cutscene before we could explore Wild Zone 2, where we find ourselves Kakuna, Patrat, Binacle, Magikarp, and Budew. In both of these Wild Zones we're missing just one Pokemon, which I can't find anywhere quite yet. Maybe it only comes out at night? Or in specific weather?

### Sidequests on Sidequests

We reach the Looker Bureau, and chat to Emma inside (who's having a nap as we enter). She asks for our assistance with some of her cases, which in this game manifest as Side Missions. Obviously, that's what we're doing now, and we get three of them to tackle.

The first I found was a lady named Moire outside Wild Zone 4 who lost her ring to a Sableye. We head inside, catch the Gastly, Ekans, Spewpa, and Spinarak around the cemetery, and of course we're one short from full completion once again. At the back of the cemetery we find the awaited Sableye, catch it, and bring the Cherished Ring back to the lady.

Just about now is when I learned how to break through the thorns on the ground: Fletchling's Ember deals with it nicely. So, since we have a shiny Fletchling, I think it's fitting to introduce our third member of the team: **Fiona the Fletchling**! Also around this time is when our team members start evolving: **Máire** evolves into **Flaaffy**, **Niamh** into **Bayleef**, and **Fiona** into **Fletchinder**! Fiona immediately proves her worth to the team, being able to tackle all the Mega Shards around with ease, since she's able to fly, and to use Quick Attack.

### The Rest of Lumiose City

Right about now's a great time to get distracted, since we finally earn access to the rest of Lumiose City! We can run around, collect all the Travel Spots we want to, go shopping, and explore Wild Zones 5 and 6. Indeed, that's what I ended up doing for a good long while.

Exploring Wild Zones 5 and 6 were easier than I expected; I thought these would be locked away from me, but it turns out we can go into any Wild Zone in Lumiose now and hold our own. I thus expect that these Wild Zones will get harder, in some way, but I'm not sure how. We get the crown for full dex completion in Zones 5 and 6, for catching Venipede, Electrike, Pidgeotto, Meditite, Buneary, Houndour, and Swablu. Hopefully, when the Wild Zones get harder, I can still go back to Zones 2, 3, and 4 and get the crown there...

The next thing I did was go to the shops and change my character's hair and outfit! It turned out I was too poor to afford everything quite that second, but running around and collecting all the waypoints, I scrounged up enough Tiny Mushrooms and Pretty Feathers to afford my new look.

And with my new outfit, I thought I'd take some pictures in Photo Mode outside Hotel Z!

### Back on Track

Okay, now that we've spent a while exploring all of Lumiose City, maybe it's time to continue the story. Our next Side Mission, number 001 for Trevelle, sees us tracking down a giant Bunnelby in an alleyway! It turns out that these are Alpha Pokemon, and we have a battle and I catch it.

Finally, we complete Mission 002, for which we trade away a Pikachu for Heracross.
