        <p>So like, this website is mostly me throwing myself at the task of making a website and hoping it'll work, and for it has, so far. I just started an HTML file in VSCode and realized that that's all one really needs, at the end of the day, although of course I'm learning first-hand why, for example, people use stylesheets and JavaScript. one of the first things I noticed, actually, while making this collection of HTML files was that I wanted to know how to reuse my HTML code, so that there'd be one thing to edit rather than multiple. I've ended up making a custom element using "Web Components" which I don't fully understand but which at least is something I can try and grasp eventually.</p>
        <p>There's a lot of things I want to do and learn with this site, some of them are probably just a Google away but I thought it'd be good to write it down here (and not just my notebook):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blog: Text formatting (How do I italicize text? What's the best way to type an en-dash?)</li>
            <li>Blog: Can I store my blog posts somewhere other than this HTML file, and then bring them in using code?</li>
            <li>Blog: Can I automatically format the blog post (by passing values for, e.g., "Post Title", "Post Date", "Post Body")?</li>
            <li>Website: New sections, for my interests (in particular, Reading, Games, Sports).</li>
            <li>Website: Put this website online somewhere.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As for myself, I feel a fever coming on, so I'm gonna go figure out what we're gonna have for dinner before it gets too much worse.</p>

        <p>Okay I'm gonna try and make a website again. I've got a bunch of ideas for what I want to put here but I know I'm gonna
        fuss about the details of how it all looks on the page so I think I'll just have a blog here also because those are cool
        right? And I've been getting into writing in my diary again, so maybe this can be another creative outlet for me. Probably I'll just forget about it lol.</p>
