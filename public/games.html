        <h3>Back to the Battle Zone</h3>
<p>It turns out we need to collect some Ticket Points in order to earn ourselves a Challenger's Ticket, so we can take on Zach for a chance at a new rank. To get these Ticket points, we're gonna have to go back to the Battle Zone, intentionally this time, and win some battles.</p>
<p>Urbain, Lida, and Naveen help us out on our first night out with tips and healing. The very first battle comes as a shock: Just as we turn the corner we get spotted by some Trainer and we get stunned! Luckily, Máire and Niamh were there, and appropriately levelled, so we easily took down our first opponent and collect some points.</p>
<p>The next two trainers are easier: We learn about sneaking up on people (and getting snuck up on), and using this to our advantage we can get a free turn at the start of the battle. Thunder Shock from Máire and Leafage from Niamh are decent damage for our first night, and Máire's Thunder Wave is fun to hit. I also taught Máire Protect, which is a blocking move, but I'm not very good at using it yet. It seems the blocking stance doesn't last very long, but it comes out very quickly, so we can react to some of our opponent's moves in time. On the other hand, moves like Quick Attack happen too quickly to react to.</p>
<p>Well, great, we've got the Ticket Points we needed, and so we get our Challenger's Ticket. There's one more trainer through the hallway, with a Pidgeotto... maybe we could have a gander? It's a Rank X trainer, that's two more than I am, but I can't see what level the Pidgeotto is, so I give it a go.</p>
<p>It turns out, our opponent is way stronger than us! The Pidgeotto easily tears through all 6 of our Pokemon, and we black out. Thankfully, we keep our Challenger's Ticket, but as we leave the Battle Zone we earn our prize money, and I think this may have been affected. Dang it!</p>
<h3>Le Z Eternel</h3>
<p>Well, great. After that embarrassing and avoidable loss, it's time to face off against Zach for our promotion match! We track him down to the taxi parking lot, heal our Pokemon, and take him on!</p>
<p>As it turns out, he's not much of a challenge. After we defeat him, we learn that we're his 100th promotion match loss in a row. Maybe beating him isn't such a rare feat, but the fact is: We just got promoted to Rank Y!</p>
<p><img alt="Promoted to Rank Y!" src="/blog/attachments/2025-10-19_PLZA-1.png" /></p>
<p>Now that we're done with the rank-up, we meet Emma the detective, and then head back to Hotel Z to have dinner with Team MZ. Time for some well-earned rest!</p>
<h3>Quick Trip Through Lumiose</h3>
<p>When we wake up and head downstairs, Urbain wants to take us to see Prism Tower, massive building in the middle of the city. Upon leaving Hotel Z, we also meet Tarragon from DYN4MO, from whom we get a Red Canari Plush and learn about Colorful Screws.</p>
<p>We learn how to climb around rooftops some more, pass by Wild Zone 2, and meet up with Urbain at the Nouveau Café (which is suspiciously Team-Flame themed!). We meet Vinnie, who works at Quasartico, and then head north towards Emma's detective agency.</p>
<p>Along the way, we get access to Wild Zone 3, within which we find Skiddo, Litleo, Espurr, Flabébé, and Pikachu. Urbain also sucked us into a cutscene before we could explore Wild Zone 2, where we find ourselves Kakuna, Patrat, Binacle, Magikarp, and Budew. In both of these Wild Zones we're missing just one Pokemon, which I can't find anywhere quite yet. Maybe it only comes out at night? Or in specific weather?</p>
<h3>Sidequests on Sidequests</h3>
<p>We reach the Looker Bureau, and chat to Emma inside (who's having a nap as we enter). She asks for our assistance with some of her cases, which in this game manifest as Side Missions. Obviously, that's what we're doing now, and we get three of them to tackle.</p>
<p>The first I found was a lady named Moire outside Wild Zone 4 who lost her ring to a Sableye. We head inside, catch the Gastly, Ekans, Spewpa, and Spinarak around the cemetery, and of course we're one short from full completion once again. At the back of the cemetery we find the awaited Sableye, catch it, and bring the Cherished Ring back to the lady.</p>
<p>Just about now is when I learned how to break through the thorns on the ground: Fletchling's Ember deals with it nicely. So, since we have a shiny Fletchling, I think it's fitting to introduce our third member of the team: <strong>Fiona the Fletchling</strong>! Also around this time is when our team members start evolving: <strong>Máire</strong> evolves into <strong>Flaaffy</strong>, <strong>Niamh</strong> into <strong>Bayleef</strong>, and <strong>Fiona</strong> into <strong>Fletchinder</strong>! Fiona immediately proves her worth to the team, being able to tackle all the Mega Shards around with ease, since she's able to fly, and to use Quick Attack.</p>
<h3>The Rest of Lumiose City</h3>
<p>Right about now's a great time to get distracted, since we finally earn access to the rest of Lumiose City! We can run around, collect all the Travel Spots we want to, go shopping, and explore Wild Zones 5 and 6. Indeed, that's what I ended up doing for a good long while.</p>
<p>Exploring Wild Zones 5 and 6 were easier than I expected; I thought these would be locked away from me, but it turns out we can go into any Wild Zone in Lumiose now and hold our own. I thus expect that these Wild Zones will get harder, in some way, but I'm not sure how. We get the crown for full dex completion in Zones 5 and 6, for catching Venipede, Electrike, Pidgeotto, Meditite, Buneary, Houndour, and Swablu. Hopefully, when the Wild Zones get harder, I can still go back to Zones 2, 3, and 4 and get the crown there...</p>
<p>The next thing I did was go to the shops and change my character's hair and outfit! It turned out I was too poor to afford everything quite that second, but running around and collecting all the waypoints, I scrounged up enough Tiny Mushrooms and Pretty Feathers to afford my new look.</p>
<p>And with my new outfit, I thought I'd take some pictures in Photo Mode outside Hotel Z!</p>

<h3>Back on Track</h3>
<p>Okay, now that we've spent a while exploring all of Lumiose City, maybe it's time to continue the story. Our next Side Mission, number 001 for Trevelle, sees us tracking down a giant Bunnelby in an alleyway! It turns out that these are Alpha Pokemon, and we have a battle and I catch it.</p>
<p>Finally, we complete Mission 002, for which we trade away a Pikachu for Heracross.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</h2>
            
            <p class="blog-post-subtitle" >Part 1</p>
            
            <p class="blog-post-date" >2025-10-18</p>
        </a>
        <p>It's Saturday today, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A released on Thursday. I'm very excited for this game, I'm really enjoying it so far, and I plan on playing it much more this weekend. I thought I'd start a little blog/diary about my playthrough, just 'cause I want to.</p>
<p>I played Pokemon Y as a kid, getting it for Christmas and loading up Marilland was so fun, so I'm looking forward to some nostalgia :) </p>
<h3>Character customization</h3>
<p>The game starts with a detailed character customization screen, which I thought was really nice. We can't change our hairstyle or outfit yet but knowing the Pokemon games there will be plenty of time to do so.</p>
<p>One choice I really appreciate in this menu are the "beauty spots", from which you can choose two placements out of a predefined selection. I've got quite a few birthmarks on my face and I do like to see them represented. </p>
<p>I also love giving my avatars olive-green hair, even if I don't see myself dyeing my hair that colour (never say never). I think if I were gonna dye my hair (again), it'd be dark blue (again).</p>
<p>Anyways, here's my avatar!</p>
<p><img alt="My PLZA avatar" src="/blog/attachments/2025-10-18_PLZA-1.png" /></p>
<h3>I'm a Tourist</h3>
<p>Okay, character customization done, now it's time to play! Upon gaining consciousness, we're taking a train trip to Gare de Lumiose, and our bag rustles mysteriously. We step off the train, get introduced to some of the controls, and head out into the city. We get instantly clocked as a tourist and start a cutscene, where we get introduced to Urbain, as well as the ominous-sounding Quasartico Inc. When we look back down from the ad, we find our bag was stolen by a Pancham!</p>
<p>Speaking of our bag, it feels like everyone in this city's roasting my bag. What's wrong with my bag?? Anyways, we do have to get it back. We chase around the Pancham until we find the people apparently responsible, and suddenly they're challenging us to a battle! It's now time for me us to choose a starter. For Trice and I the choice was easy: Welcome back from HeartGold, <strong>Niamh the Chikorita</strong>!</p>
<p>We learn an entirely new way to battle, easily defeating the Pancham, and get our bag back! But now, it's nighttime, and we're in a "Battle Zone". We're not ready for this! Urbain and us try escape the Battle Zone... we battle past one poor trainer, and then when we're about to reach the safe area we get cornered by a group of three who look like they're about to challenge us. Right then, an Eternal Floette appears and uses Light of Ruin to save us! What a hero.</p>
<p>We make it to Hotel Z, meet AZ the owner, and head up to our room to rest. Just kidding, one more cutscene with Urbain on the roof! Okay, now it's time to rest.</p>
<h3>Becoming a Trainer</h3>
<p>When we wake up (and I think the lights are all on), we go downstairs and Urbain gets me to join the Z-A Royale. I get an email with a downloadable app, which obviously I immediately install because that's very safe and something we should teach kids to do. We join "Team MZ", whatever that is, and get a sweet jacket! We also meet Lida, and now it's time to go outside.</p>
<p>Outside we get the tutorial for climbing ladders and jumping off rooftops, because that's very safe and something we should teach kids to do, and we head to the Pokemon Center. It was pretty shocking to see that there's no separate individual to act as the Poke Mart, it's just Nurse Joy now!</p>
<p>We head to the Wild Zone and learn about catching Pokemon, a very similar system to Pokemon Legends: Arceus, except I think in that game you couldn't defeat a Pokemon in battle and then catch it. I think with the way this game treats battles, being far less turn-based, that system wouldn't work, and this system feels a lot more integrated into the flow of the game.</p>
<p>Now, to claim our reward we go to the Pokemon Lab, and... what are you doing here!? Mable, from the evil Team Flare, is the acting director? And did Professor Sycamore retire? That's not something our player character knows, of course, but as a Pokemon fan I'm certainly suspicious... She's even got the Team Flare logo on some of her stuff!</p>
<p>It seems it's finally time to gain our (relative) independence as a Trainer! We meet Naveen and his Scraggy (SCRAGGY'S IN THIS GAME YESSSSS) and learn he embroidered the Team MZ logo on our jacket, and learn about using field moves like Rock Smash.</p>
<p>Okay, cool. Time to go explore Lumiose!</p>
<h3>In and Around Wild Zone 1</h3>
<p>Now, back to Wild Zone 1. We've already caught Fletchling, Bunnelby, Scatterbug, Mareep, and Weedle for the tutorial mission. Exploring a bit we also find Pidgey, Pichu, Flabébé, Kakuna and Abra. Time to catch all of these! It seems different Pokemon have different behaviours, just like in Legends: Arceus, in particular, Pichu and Abra run away, which make them rather trickier to catch.</p>
<p>Now's a good time to add another Pokemon to our team: and who better to bring back than <strong>Máire the Mareep</strong>, also from the HeartGold playthrough? I don't think all of my team's names are gonna be Irish, but we'll figure it out as we go along.</p>
<p>While running around Wild Zone 1, we see our very first <strong>shiny Pokemon</strong>! I went and looked up the odds and the base rate is 1/4096, so that's very fortunate! We got a shiny <strong>Fletchling</strong>, in a nice warm yellow tint.</p>
<p>There's one more thing I wanted to mention: While running around I noticed the south gate of Lumiose, which is the first entrance to Lumiose we use in the Generation 6 games! That was a big hit of nostalgia for me.</p>
<p>Satisfied with our exploration in the limited space we have available, we head back to Hotel Z and talk to Urbain. Looks like we got a promotion match!</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Pokemon HeartGold</h2>
            
            <p class="blog-post-subtitle" >Part 1</p>
            
            <p class="blog-post-date" >2025-10-14</p>
        </a>
        <p>A few days ago (on the 11th to be precise) Trice and I started a playthrough of Pokemon HeartGold, which I'm playing on the Delta Emulator on iOS. Johto is one of the two regions I've not yet played, the other being Alola, so HeartGold has been around the top of my list of games to play for a while now.</p>
<p>Of course, as I write this, it's just two days away from the release of Pokemon Legends ZA (2025-10-16), so that game might supercede this one for a while. Nonetheless, I'm gonna write a little diary about how this playthrough of Pokemon HeartGold is going, and update it as I go along, however much that ends up being.</p>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>Our journey begins in New Bark Town (after a nostalgic Professor Oak cutscene), and we get immediately reminded that this is a DS Pokemon game and you do not get to run yet! The walking speed is agonizingly slow, but thankfully it doesn't last for too long in this game.</p></p>
<p>We go to Professor Elm's lab where we get our first Pokemon! This is always a difficult decision for me; thankfully I didn't have to make it: Trice chose <strong>Chikorita</strong>! We named her <strong>Niamh</strong>, with an eye to her final evolution, Meganium (she's technically a male Pokemon but we didn't bother soft-resetting for a girl).</p>
<p>We also get our initial tasks, which are to head over to Mr. Pokemon's house, obtain the Running Shoes along the way, head back with the Mystery Egg, bump into and battle the red-haired boy. Once we get back we find out that one of the other starter Pokemon were stolen by the red-haired boy and we get to name him! I just called him Silver, which is his canon name, since I'm not a big fan of renaming my rivals in the first place.</p>
<p>We get taught to use Poke Balls by Ethan and we're finally on our way, properly this time. In Route 29 we catch our second team member, <strong>Aoife the Sentret</strong>, as we decide to give each of our team members Irish names. We go by Cherrygrove City, Route 30, Route 31, and end up in Violet City.</p>
<h3>Violet City</h3>
<p>The first time upon reaching Violet City, the amount of new space to explore was a little overwhelming: There's Route 32 to the south, Route 36 to the west, and the Ruins of Alph in between the two. I think the Ruins of Alph is ignorable for now, and the other two Routes are blocked off relatively early on, so it's all fine actually.</p>
<p>Getting here we've been giving Aoife a lot of the experience, since the first Gym Leader, Falkner, is a Flying-type specialist. We climb Sprout Tower with Aoife, with the Normal-type Scratch and Quick Attack making quick work of all the Bellsprouts. We reach the top, fight Elder Li, and head back to the Gym.</p>
<p>The Violet City Gym was pretty fun to run through with Aoife, who's just learned Fury Swipes at Level 13. Falkner's the first trainer that gives us a real challenge - his own Level 13 Pidgeotto is far more powerful than anything we've seen so far - but we got very lucky in the fight, Aoife getting 5 hits of Fury Swipes twice in a row to take down Falkner's ace in just two attacks. Thus, thanks to our incredible Sentret, we obtain the Zephyr badge!</p>
<h3>Onwards to Azalea Town</h3>
<p>Now it's time to head south towards Azalea Town. In Route 32, we pick up yet another Pokemon for our team: <strong>Máire the Mareep</strong>! Sure, she could have come in handy against Falkner, but we hadn't met her yet. We caught Máire right before the entrance to Union Cave, so we're about to have a nice time switch training for a while.</p>
<p>And actually, we went through all of Union Cave with Máire in our first team-slot, which we didn't realize was attracting more wild Pokemon using her Static ability! We caught on at the exit to Route 33, and swapped in Aoife to head back up the cave to fully explore the top path. So much easier! I guess that's what we get for trying to train an Electric type in a cave.</p>
<p>Finally, we exit the cave, fight one last trainer on Route 33, and reach the Azalea Town Pokemon Center. That's where we're up to, for now. I'm having lots of fun and I even though I can't wait for Legends ZA, I also don't think I'll stop also playing HeartGold. We'll see.</p>
