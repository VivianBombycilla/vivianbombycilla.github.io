        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Pokemon Legends: Z-A, 2025-10-18</h2>
        <p>It's Saturday today, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A released on Thursday. I'm very excited for this game, I'm really enjoying it so far, and I plan on playing it much more this weekend. I thought I'd start a little blog/diary about my playthrough, just 'cause I want to.</p>
<p>I played Pokemon Y as a kid, getting it for Christmas and loading up Marilland was so fun, so I'm looking forward to some nostalgia :) </p>
<h3>Character customization</h3>
<p>The game starts with a detailed character customization screen, which I thought was really nice. We can't change our hairstyle or outfit yet but knowing the Pokemon games there will be plenty of time to do so.</p>
<p>One choice I really appreciate in this menu are the "beauty spots", from which you can choose two placements out of a predefined selection. I've got quite a few birthmarks on my face and I do like to see them represented. </p>
<p>I also love giving my avatars olive-green hair, even if I don't see myself dyeing my hair that colour (never say never). I think if I were gonna dye my hair (again), it'd be dark blue (again).</p>
<p>Anyways, here's my avatar!

<h3>I'm a Tourist</h3>
<p>Okay, character customization done, now it's time to play! Upon gaining consciousness, we're taking a train trip to Gare de Lumiose, and our bag rustles mysteriously. We step off the train, get introduced to some of the controls, and head out into the city. We get instantly clocked as a tourist and start a cutscene, where we get introduced to Urbain, as well as the ominous-sounding Quasartico Inc. When we look back down from the ad, we find our bag was stolen by a Pancham!</p>
<p>Speaking of our bag, it feels like everyone in this city's roasting my bag. What's wrong with my bag?? Anyways, we do have to get it back. We chase around the Pancham until we find the people apparently responsible, and suddenly they're challenging us to a battle! It's now time for me us to choose a starter. For Trice and I the choice was easy: Welcome back from HeartGold, <strong>Niamh the Chikorita</strong>!</p>
<p>We learn an entirely new way to battle, easily defeating the Pancham, and get our bag back! But now, it's nighttime, and we're in a "Battle Zone". We're not ready for this! Urbain and us try escape the Battle Zone... we battle past one poor trainer, and then when we're about to reach the safe area we get cornered by a group of three who look like they're about to challenge us. Right then, an Eternal Floette appears and uses Light of Ruin to save us! What a hero.</p>
<p>We make it to Hotel Z, meet AZ the owner, and head up to our room to rest. Just kidding, one more cutscene with Urbain on the roof! Okay, now it's time to rest.</p>
<h3>Becoming a Trainer</h3>
<p>When we wake up (and I think the lights are all on), we go downstairs and Urbain gets me to join the Z-A Royale. I get an email with a downloadable app, which obviously I immediately install because that's very safe and something we should teach kids to do. We join "Team MZ", whatever that is, and get a sweet jacket! And now it's time to go outside.</p>
<p>Outside we get the tutorial for climbing ladders and jumping off rooftops, because that's very safe and something we should teach kids to do, and we head to the Pokemon Center. It was pretty shocking to see that there's no separate individual to act as the Poke Mart, it's just Nurse Joy now!</p>
<p>We head to the Wild Zone and learn about catching Pokemon, a very similar system to Pokemon Legends: Arceus, except I think in that game you couldn't defeat a Pokemon in battle and then catch it. I think with the way this game treats battles, being far less turn-based, that system wouldn't work, and this system feels a lot more integrated into the flow of the game.</p>
<p>Now, to claim our reward we go to the Pokemon Lab, and... what are you doing here!? Mable, from the evil Team Flare, is the acting director? And did Professor Sycamore retire? That's not something our player character knows, of course, but as a Pokemon fan I'm certainly suspicious... She's even got the Team Flare logo on some of her stuff!</p>
<p>We learn about TMs and field moves, and it seems that finally we're gonna get our independence as a Trainer. Time to go explore Lumiose!</p>
<h3>In and Around Wild Zone 1</h3>
<p>Now, back to Wild Zone 1. We've already caught Fletchling, Bunnelby, Scatterbug, Mareep, and Weedle for the tutorial mission. Exploring a bit we also find Pidgey, Pichu, Flabébé, Kakuna and Abra. Time to catch all of these! It seems different Pokemon have different behaviours, just like in Legends: Arceus, in particular, Pichu and Abra run away, which make them rather trickier to catch.</p>
<p>Now's a good time to add another Pokemon to our team: and who better to bring back than <strong>Máire the Mareep</strong>, also from the HeartGold playthrough? I don't think all of my team's names are gonna be Irish, but we'll figure it out as we go along.</p>
<p>While running around Wild Zone 1, we see our very first <strong>shiny Pokemon</strong>! I went and looked up the odds and the base rate is 1/4096, so that's very fortunate! We got a shiny Fletchling, in a nice warm yellow tint.</p>
<p>There's one more thing I wanted to mention: While running around I noticed the south gate of Lumiose, which is the first entrance to Lumiose we use in the Generation 6 games! That was a big hit of nostalgia for me.</p>
<p>Satisfied with our exploration in the limited space we have available, we head back to Hotel Z and talk to Urbain. Looks like we got a promotion match!</p>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Pokemon HeartGold, 2025-10-14</h2>
        <p>A few days ago (on the 11th to be precise) Trice and I started a playthrough of Pokemon HeartGold, which I'm playing on the Delta Emulator on iOS. Johto is one of the two regions I've not yet played, the other being Alola, so HeartGold has been around the top of my list of games to play for a while now.</p>
<p>Of course, as I write this, it's just two days away from the release of Pokemon Legends ZA (2025-10-16), so that game might supercede this one for a while. Nonetheless, I'm gonna write a little diary about how this playthrough of Pokemon HeartGold is going, and update it as I go along, however much that ends up being.</p>
<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>Our journey begins in New Bark Town (after a nostalgic Professor Oak cutscene), and we get immediately reminded that this is a DS Pokemon game and you do not get to run yet! The walking speed is agonizingly slow, but thankfully it doesn't last for too long in this game.</p></p>
<p>We go to Professor Elm's lab where we get our first Pokemon! This is always a difficult decision for me; thankfully I didn't have to make it: Trice chose <strong>Chikorita</strong>! We named her <strong>Niamh</strong>, with an eye to her final evolution, Meganium (she's technically a male Pokemon but we didn't bother soft-resetting for a girl).</p>
<p>We also get our initial tasks, which are to head over to Mr. Pokemon's house, obtain the Running Shoes along the way, head back with the Mystery Egg, bump into and battle the red-haired boy. Once we get back we find out that one of the other starter Pokemon were stolen by the red-haired boy and we get to name him! I just called him Silver, which is his canon name, since I'm not a big fan of renaming my rivals in the first place.</p>
<p>We get taught to use Poke Balls by Ethan and we're finally on our way, properly this time. In Route 29 we catch our second team member, <strong>Aoife the Sentret</strong>, as we decide to give each of our team members Irish names. We go by Cherrygrove City, Route 30, Route 31, and end up in Violet City.</p>
<h3>Violet City</h3>
<p>The first time upon reaching Violet City, the amount of new space to explore was a little overwhelming: There's Route 32 to the south, Route 36 to the west, and the Ruins of Alph in between the two. I think the Ruins of Alph is ignorable for now, and the other two Routes are blocked off relatively early on, so it's all fine actually.</p>
<p>Getting here we've been giving Aoife a lot of the experience, since the first Gym Leader, Falkner, is a Flying-type specialist. We climb Sprout Tower with Aoife, with the Normal-type Scratch and Quick Attack making quick work of all the Bellsprouts. We reach the top, fight Elder Li, and head back to the Gym.</p>
<p>The Violet City Gym was pretty fun to run through with Aoife, who's just learned Fury Swipes at Level 13. Falkner's the first trainer that gives us a real challenge - his own Level 13 Pidgeotto is far more powerful than anything we've seen so far - but we got very lucky in the fight, Aoife getting 5 hits of Fury Swipes twice in a row to take down Falkner's ace in just two attacks. Thus, thanks to our incredible Sentret, we obtain the Zephyr badge!</p>
<h3>Onwards to Azalea Town</h3>
<p>Now it's time to head south towards Azalea Town. In Route 32, we pick up yet another Pokemon for our team: <strong>Máire the Mareep</strong>! Sure, she could have come in handy against Falkner, but we hadn't met her yet. We caught Máire right before the entrance to Union Cave, so we're about to have a nice time switch training for a while.</p>
<p>And actually, we went through all of Union Cave with Máire in our first team-slot, which we didn't realize was attracting more wild Pokemon using her Static ability! We caught on at the exit to Route 33, and swapped in Aoife to head back up the cave to fully explore the top path. So much easier! I guess that's what we get for trying to train an Electric type in a cave.</p>
<p>Finally, we exit the cave, fight one last trainer on Route 33, and reach the Azalea Town Pokemon Center. That's where we're up to, for now. I'm having lots of fun and I even though I can't wait for Legends ZA, I also don't think I'll stop also playing HeartGold. We'll see.</p>
