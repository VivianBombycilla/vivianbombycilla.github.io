        <h2>Solutions to past and current problems</h2>
        <h5>2025-10-01</h5>
        <p>First off, the past problems:</p>
        <p>It turns out I only added the regular weight font, so some parts of my website (specifically the headings) were showing up as regular weight when they should be <b>bold</b>. That's fixed now, I just had to add the rest of the styles and link it in the stylesheet.</p>
        <p>Another past issue was one I noted in my blog post on 2025-09-07:</p>
        <ul><li>Blog: Text formatting (How do I italicize text? What's the best way to type an en-dash?)</li></ul>
        <p>I've also figured out text formatting, it was indeed a Google away. I think I prefer the markdown style of text formatting, at least typing it out, but I can appreciate the utility, with CSS in mind, of needing a separate element. Also, with UTF-8 encoding, all I need to type an en-dash is to type an en-dash, or type <code>&amp;ndash;</code>. I find TeX's shortcuts for en-dashes and em-dashes more elegant, but once again I can see why this is how it is it HTML.</p>
        <p>And now, my present dilemma, which is summed up by these two items also from my post on 2025-09-07:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blog: Can I store my blog posts somewhere other than this HTML file, and then bring them in using code?</li>
            <li>Blog: Can I automatically format the blog post (by passing values for, e.g., "Post Title", "Post Date", "Post
                Body")?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I've been kind of stuck with what I want to do here. I have several options here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I can try out a static site generator (I've used Gatsby for a bit before, but I'd use Astro instead if I tried again)</li>
            <li>I can store my blog posts in a database, and then I use code to add it to this page.</li>
        </ul>
        If it's not obvious, I'm not sure how either of these would go. I'm familiar with taking data out of an Excel spreadsheet using Python, and I <i>could</i> use Python as a kind of generator for my HTML. On the other hand, maybe it would be simpler or more instructive if I did something else. There's only one way to find out, and it's to do something, so stay tuned I guess.

        <h2>A Website on the Internet</h2>
        <h5>2025-09-18</h5>
        <p>I just got the website up on Github Pages! To be quite honest I want to change my Github account name but I shan't do that until I get a job, since my Github has started appearing in my resume and stuff. But for now, it's live on <a href="https://vivianbombycilla.github.io">vivianbombycilla.github.io</a>.</p>
        <p>Also I managed to bring on a custom font, namely <a href="https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht">Alegreya Sans</a> from Huerta Typographia, which I really like.</p>

        <h2>What this is, and what it'll be next</h2>
        <h5>2025-09-07</h5>
        <p>So like, this website is mostly me throwing myself at the task of making a website and hoping it'll work, and for it has, so far. I just started an HTML file in VSCode and realized that that's all one really needs, at the end of the day, although of course I'm learning first-hand why, for example, people use stylesheets and JavaScript. one of the first things I noticed, actually, while making this collection of HTML files was that I wanted to know how to reuse my HTML code, so that there'd be one thing to edit rather than multiple. I've ended up making a custom element using "Web Components" which I don't fully understand but which at least is something I can try and grasp eventually.</p>
        <p>There's a lot of things I want to do and learn with this site, some of them are probably just a Google away but I thought it'd be good to write it down here (and not just my notebook):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blog: Text formatting (How do I italicize text? What's the best way to type an en-dash?)</li>
            <li>Blog: Can I store my blog posts somewhere other than this HTML file, and then bring them in using code?</li>
            <li>Blog: Can I automatically format the blog post (by passing values for, e.g., "Post Title", "Post Date", "Post Body")?</li>
            <li>Website: New sections, for my interests (in particular, Reading, Games, Sports).</li>
            <li>Website: Put this website online somewhere.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As for myself, I feel a fever coming on, so I'm gonna go figure out what we're gonna have for dinner before it gets too much worse.</p>

        <h2>Under construction</h2>
        <h5>2025-09-06</h5>
        <p>Okay I'm gonna try and make a website again. I've got a bunch of ideas for what I want to put here but I know I'm gonna
        fuss about the details of how it all looks on the page so I think I'll just have a blog here also because those are cool
        right? And I've been getting into writing in my diary again, so maybe this can be another creative outlet for me. Probably I'll just forget about it lol.</p>
