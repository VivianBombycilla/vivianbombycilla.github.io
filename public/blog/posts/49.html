        <p class="blog-post-subtitle" >Part 5: Axis breaks</p>
        <p class="blog-post-date">2025-12-17</p>
        <p>I've been working on drawing <strong>axis breaks</strong> using my program. To do this, I will first need:
- A way to translate from "plot" coordinates to "panel/SVG" coordinates.
- A way to store the plot limits as well as panel dimensions.</p>
<p>I've made a <code>Box</code> class, which is a named tuple containing parameters <code>x_lims</code> and <code>y_lims</code> denoting the boundary of a box. I've also added on some computed properties, <code>x_min</code>, <code>x_max</code>, <code>y_min</code>, and <code>y_max</code>: I've used the <code>@property</code> decorator in the class definition which is pretty fun, and something I've not known to do before :) Python's got more depth than I know so far... I do wonder where I can learn more of what I might want to do in Python, and what I might be overlooking in my mind because I instantly filter it as impossible or too much effort. Perhaps a college course, or studiously following a textbook, or maybe just keeping on trying and thinking and iterating on this project!</p>
<p>Anyways, I built my translation functions: A <code>rescale</code> function which I intend to act similarly to <code>scale</code> in R (and I do wonder if this could go in a personal library of useful functions I find myself rewriting), plus some <code>GSToolGraphic</code> class-specific functions to translate along the x- and y- axes. I do wonder if there's something clever I can do to condense both of these functions I've defined, <code>rescale_plot_to_panel_x</code> and <code>rescale_plot_to_panel_y</code>, to one function which takes a toggle for the axis, similarly to how the <code>axis</code> parameter works in the <code>pandas</code> library. Should I use an enum class, for clarity?</p>
<p>Finally, I built my functions to draw axis breaks on my skeleton graphic, and it all works as expected! I designed it to ignore breaks outside the plottable area quietly, although maybe it should pass a warning? I think when I used ggplot2 I did make use of the fact that this kind of thing would fail quietly but maybe there's no such need for me now, if I play my cards right and keep everything simple.</p>
<p>There's just one issue which is that the lines don't join together, although maybe this will be mitigated by adding my own ticks? We'll see...</p>
