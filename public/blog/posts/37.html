        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Advent of Code 2025: C++</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-subtitle" >Day 00: Getting Started</p>
        <p class="blog-post-date">2025-12-01</p>
        <p>Last year was my first year successfully getting all stars in Advent of Code, and I did so in Python. This year I want to do it in C++, which is a language I have essentially zero experience in. Should be fun!</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To begin with, <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/">Learn C++</a> looks like a helpful tool to get started, so I followed the introductory Chapter 0 a while ago to get set up.  I followed <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw">this tutorial</a> to be able to use the GCC C++ compiler in VS Code, skimmed Chapter 1 (the biggest thing I didn't know was the differences between the different variable initialization styles), and then went straight to <a href="https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/basic-file-io/">Chapter 28.6</a> to get started with file I/O (since I'm going to have to read inputs from a file).</p>
<p>Now, right away, I ran into an issue. When I clicked the button in VS Code to run and debug my program, the output (and input) files were found in the folder containing <code>g++.exe</code>, that is, <code>C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin</code>, instead of my working directory which is where I'd rather they go. So, what's up with that? Figuring this out meant understanding a bit more about how VS Code works, but I figured it out: When I click the "play" button and select <code>g++.exe</code> as my compiler, this compiles my <code>.exe</code> file from my <code>.cpp</code> file, and saves the settings as a task in <code>tasks.json</code>. Then, it also <em>runs</em> this <code>.exe</code> file, but the working directory never gets updated from that one containing <code>g++.exe</code>.</p>
<p>If I instead click the settings cog first, "Add Debug Configuration", and select <code>g++.exe</code> from there, VS Code creates not only the appropriate <code>tasks.json</code> file, but also <code>launch.json</code>, which contains a configuration for running and debugging the code. Within this configuration, the parameter <code>cwd</code> is set to <code>"C:\\msys64\\ucrt64\\bin"</code>, that is, the folder containing <code>g++.exe</code>, but if I change this instead to <code>${fileDirname}</code> the program will instead run my <code>.exe</code> from the directory of the <code>.exe</code> file itself. Thus, I can use file I/O with relative paths, and the program will behave much more as expected, and the source code will be more portable as well.</p>
