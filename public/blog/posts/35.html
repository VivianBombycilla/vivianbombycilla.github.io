        <p class="blog-post-subtitle" >Part 1: Mission Statement</p>
        <p class="blog-post-date">2025-11-25</p>
        <h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>My goal with this project is to build a tool to easily turn data from a sports league into a nice-looking graphic that I can share with others. </p>
<p>In most professional sports leagues, each team plays a certain number of games in a season, the results of which determine their position in the final standings. I want to plot the relative performance of each team over the course of the season, to provide an at-a-glance overview of how the season went.</p>
<p>The <strong>input</strong> can be split into two main components: <strong>data</strong> and <strong>style</strong>. The <strong>data</strong> from the sports league season will be plotted and visualized in the graphic. The <strong>style</strong> will be aesthetic settings otherwise related to the graphic, such as label positioning and major/minor breaks.</p>
<p>The <strong>output</strong> will be SVG files created by the ElementTree extension in Python. This is something I've been dabbling with for a long time, so I can give you some examples of what I'm going for: See my (as of writing) <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1p0jwux/nfl_graphical_standings_week_11_2025/">most recent post</a> on Reddit.</p>
<h3>Minimum success criteria</h3>
<p>Given that I have examples of what I'm going for already, why am I starting a blog, a multi-part blog at that, about developing this tool further? That's because I'm not happy with how the tool exists in its current state. It's a clunky piece of code and it takes an outsize amount of effort to run every week.</p>
<p>I will consider this project a success if the following criteria are met:
- The program should take data from a season (possibly in progress) and produce an SVG visualizing the data in the way desired.
- The program should <strong>not</strong> rely on any external tools, such as Google Sheets, to run easily and efficiently.
- The program should be able to work without league-specific modifications on each of the NFL, PWHL, and WSL.
    - The NFL has ties as well as bye weeks, which I want to distinguish from each other (for example by using a <strong>dashed line</strong> for bye weeks).
    - The PWHL gives points to teams differently based on <strong>whether the game went to overtime or not</strong>.
    - The WSL has an <strong>asymmetric points system</strong> (as common in soccer leagues): 3 points for a win, 1 for a tie, 0 for a loss.
- My Python code should be well-documented and easy to maintain.
    - In particular I will use docstrings and maintain a consistent style throughout.
    - Maybe I'll use type hinting as well, depending on how nicely this plays with pandas DataFrames and Series with ambiguous detected types within.</p>
<h3>Bonus</h3>
<p>There are things I want to be able to do, not right now but in the future, and which will require each of the minimum success criteria to be met before I can start thinking about them.
- Tiebreaking. When two teams are tied in the standings, which one is on top? For my minimum success I will not specify what order they should be in: Just a consistent one, such as alphabetical.
- Interactivity. Using JavaScript I can make the graphic change when hovering or clicking certain elements. My (yet minimal) CSS and web development experience should help me with this.</p>
