        <p class="blog-post-subtitle" >Week 50 of 2025</p>
        <p class="blog-post-date">2025-12-08</p>
        <p>Last week was a very successful event for me: I reached a new best on Greengrass Isle (Expert) and I got to see 5 new sleep styles!</p>
<p>This week I'm actually going to Amber Canyon again, which is a bit of a left turn, but I think that it's actually worth it even without the event-improved spawns and without getting to Master 3. I used to think that getting the weekly incense at Master 3 was important, but I think it's more valuable as a benchmark for how you're doing on a new island than as a reward itself. On the other hand, if I wanted to only go back to Amber Canyon once it had enough roll-over Area Bonus for me to get to Master 3, I wouldn't be here for, like, months and months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the increase from 75% to 80% Area Bonus on an island I'm good at is just smaller than going from 15% to 20% on the new island. So, I think I'll go to Amber Canyon some more in the future as well! Maybe I'll even spam it. My Strength Record is just at 1 million here, and Master 3 is 1.65 million. I'll get there!</p>
<p>It's Desserts/Drinks week, and I've just got the idea to use some Magnezone procs to raise my "Flower Gift" Macarons level, since that's the obvious next spammable dish. My Magnezone is just at Main Skill Level 3/7, but I'm not too fussed about it yet, the 12 extra helps with cooking these soon-to-be-spammable dishes. My December Main Skill Seed is therefore going to Dedenne, which is now Main Skill Level 6/6.</p>
<p>P.S. I leveled my 🥔🥔🥔 Meowscarada to level 60 last week, and my 🥛🥛🥛 Blastoise to level 60 this week. Goodbye, Dream Shards!</p>
