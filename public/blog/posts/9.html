        <p class="blog-post-date">2025-10-14</p>
        <p>So I've worked on the navbar a little more: Specifically, I replaced the bullet point with an SVG, so that the spacing is better. Along the way, I found that the navbar I was working on was showing up differently between Firefox and Chrome. It turned out okay, and pretty easy to pinpoint: The <code>list-style-image</code> attribute was giving slightly different default spacing values, which I did not want to deal with. Thankfully, I was also considering just modifying the <code>content</code> attribute of the <code>list::marker</code> elements, and this gave consistent spacing between browsers (Firefox and Chrome, at least).</p>
<p>What else? I've also changed the spacing a little: I added a <code>max-width</code> value so the content stays in a narrow enough column in the middle to remain easy enough to read on different devices. I guess thinking about different browser experiences is a theme here.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go read a book now. :)</p>
