        <h3>Our team</h3>
<ul>
<li>Niamh the Meganium (Mega)</li>
<li>Máire the Ampharos</li>
<li>Fiona the Shiny Talonflame</li>
<li>Ambrosia the Absol (Mega)</li>
<li>Arthur the Slowbro (Mega)</li>
<li>Aurora the Aurorus</li>
<li>Tina the Scrafty</li>
</ul>
<h3>Getting to Rank D</h3>
<p>The battle with Ivor goes smoothly; we have enough strong Pokemon to deal with all of the Fighting types thrown at us. Fiona led the charge, but after taking a few Rock type attacks, Arthur's strong Psychic-type moves (and strong defensive typing) finished the job.</p>

<h3>Urbain what the hell</h3>
<p>Back at Hotel Z, Lida and Naveen are here but Urbain is not! We get a really scary call from the Rust Syndicate, telling us that Urbain's in a whole lot of debt, and that we're gonna have to visit their headquarters in the Bleu Sector. When we arrive, there are two Rust Syndicate Grunts who want to fight us, and then one of the Rust Syndicate's top brass: Philippe! We get a bunch of classic bad-guy Pokemon, especially Dark and Poison types, as well as Philippe's ace, Mega Skarmory. Máire has a great type matchup into this Steel/Flying type, so that's how we defeat yet another beautiful new Mega.</p>
<p>Once we've beat Philippe, we get invited into the Rust Syndicate office, a very intimidating and ominous place! We walk slowly and respectfully to the elevator to the office of the boss: Mr. Corbeau. He gives us the run-down of what happened, how much debt Urbain's in (900 thousand Pokedollars!), and tells us that the Rust Syndicate will be in touch with tasks we can do to repay them.</p>
<h3>Rogue Megas of Rank D</h3>
<p>We don't have our Rust Syndicate tasks yet, so we're back at Hotel Z and having a strategy meeting for our 3 new Rogue Mega fights. This time, they're Ampharos, Barbaracle, and Mawile. That means we're gonna get an Ampharosite for Máire! </p>
<p>The fights go mostly without a hitch. Against Barbaracle, which spawned a lot of Binacle, I decided to figure out what happens if I lose all my HP: Indeed, I black out, but there's an option to keep the fight going with my progress, to back out, or to start the fight over. That's really cute, I think, to give the player a lot of options to curate our own experience and difficulty! </p>
<p>So, we pick up our Mawilite, Ampharosite, and finally Barbaraclite (who was hidden in a pretty sneaky underground bit), to initiate the next Zygarde/L cutscene... Still as mysterious as ever. What's going on with them?</p>
<h3>Side Quests</h3>
<p>Now's a decent time to get some Side Missions out of the way. First, we help reach a Scyther some moves, to help it become a pro Furfrou Trimmer. We fix a Holovator using a Fighting-type move, get Carvanha an acting gig, and escort some Trubbish to the bins. The cutest Side Mission, this time, were the Binacle who wants to hang out by someone's boat. We first tried to fight them away, but then, actually we realize that the Binacle just want to hang out on the boat! Yay!</p>
<p>We also battle some trainers who each have a theme: A Pidgeot fan, Camerupt fan (opening a hot springs for wild Pokemon), a fan of Pokemon who evolve by friendship (Clefairy and Lopunny), and two fans of moves: Detect and Focus Energy. Around this time, we also add a new member to the team: <strong>Pepper the Drilbur</strong>, who we evolve into <strong>Excadrill</strong> (and buy the Excadrillite for from Quasartico).  I noticed we didn't have a great answer to Dragon types, Fairy types, or Electric types, so Pepper's incredible typing (and incredible cute nose) will be a very welcome addition to the team.</p>
