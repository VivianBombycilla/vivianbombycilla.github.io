        <h3>Becoming The Canari Quiz Whiz</h3>
<p>Now that we have our Challenger's Ticket, it's time to go participate in the Canari Quiz Whiz contest. With Naveen in our earpiece, we get past the security guard at the electrical substation, and are ready and raring to go! Canari appears as a hologram – she apparently doesn't do in-person public appearances – and starts spamming emotes at the hilariously sparse crowd. Let's do DYN4MOThunder Wave!!! (*waves my hands*)</p>
<p>The first round consists of us answering questions by running to the correct box on the ground. I didn't need Naveen for the first two questions, because Naveen mentioned those facts to us when he was on his phone watching the stream during our strategy meeting, and then I guessed the third question correctly. Out of the contestants who perfected Round 1, there's one who's being quite dismissive of us, what's your deal??</p>
<p>The second round had us go collect Canari's Eelektross's favourite snack, which is something I definitely don't know. Naveen, help us out! He tells us to mosey over to Café Gallant, where he's waiting an stylishly orders not just any Lumiose Galette, but a <strong>Super Lumiose Galette</strong>, one that's got a backstory for why Canari's Eelektross prefers it. When we got to the Café, the rude guy was leaving, so it's no surprise to us that out of everyone left (including one trainer with a very stylish Chandelure headpiece), just me and that guy brought the correct snack! So, it's just down to the two of us, and to decide who becomes the Canari Quiz Whiz, it turns out we have to battle this guy! We finally get his name: Mani, what an asshole, and he's not a problem for our team to take down.</p>
<p>So it's finally time for our reward: One wish of our choosing! Of course, we want a promotion match, that's what we're here for! Canari's shocked, but tells us to go to Racine Construction. I knew that place had something to do with Canari...</p>
<h3>Getting to Rank E</h3>
<p>At Racine Construction, as expected, we're greeted by Tarragon, who tells us to come with him to the garage. Then, completely NOT as expected, he tells us some secrets: One, that he's Canari's grandfather, and two, that he was the one behind the hologram the whole time!!! What!! Canari's still a real person though, but to get to her, we'll first have to defeat Tarragon in battle. This is not a big issue, although Stealth Rock did a LOT of damage, and not just to Fiona. Maybe this move is good in this game?? Also, we get to see Mega Excadrill for the first time, which is incredibly cool.</p>
<p>And then it's time for Canari. She greets us, coming out of her room in the corner of the garage. So cool! Predictably, she has a primarily Electric-type team, so Niamh the Meganium is gonna put in a hell of a shift. In fact, we didn't even have to switch Niamh out for the whole fight! Resisting Electric type moves is just that powerful against an Electric-type Trainer. Niamh got paralyzed by a Discharge from Ampharos, Canari's second Pokemon, but it didn't even matter because of Swords Dance, Leaf Blade, and Bullet Seed. Mega Eelektross is absolutely beautiful and I want one :)</p>

<h3>The Rogue Megas of Rank E</h3>
<p>We go back to Hotel Z, and have a really cute conversation at dinner :) It feels like Naveen's coming out of his shell a little and expressing his appreciation of the wonderful group we have here, of which he sure is an important member.</p>
<p>The next morning, predictably, we have some new Rogue Megas to deal with, so a Team MZ strategy meeting is called: This time, the three Rogue Megas are Beedrill, Hawlucha, and Banette. These three are not too difficult to take down: Mega Beedrill matches up well into our team except against Fiona the Talonflame, but is itself quite frail so Swords Dance boosted Plus Moves are enough. Mega Hawlucha and Mega Banette are weak to Arthur the Slowpoke and Ambrosia the Absol respectively, who can both Mega Evolve to make the fight even easier. </p>
<p>Zygarde and L make another appearance after our last Rogue Mega fight. Seriously, what's their deal? Oh well... With the Rogue Megas out of the way, we get our next Promotion Match: Ivor from the Justice Dojo! Finally, a team update: <strong>Aurora</strong>, our Amaura, has evolved and become an <strong>Aurorus</strong>!</p>
