        <p class="blog-post-subtitle" >Part 6: Enums and list comprehension</p>
        <p class="blog-post-date">2025-12-17</p>
        <p>My incredibly knowledgeable girlfriend has pointed me to some very useful ideas and tools over the years. Two in particular stand out today: <strong>enums</strong> and <strong>list comprehension</strong>.</p>
<h3>Enums</h3>
<p>In the last blog post, I was complaining about writing two separate functions, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis, several times. I thought about condensing these functions, which are indeed quite similar to each other, into single functions, with a parameter denoting the axis, similarly to how <code>pandas</code> does things, although I wasn't thrilled with having a mysterious boolean or integer which I may one day forget the meaning of.</p>
<p>Therefore, enums! Defining a new enum <code>Axis</code> is easy and makes these new <code>axis</code> parameters I'm adding so much more readable. Finally, the type-checker I'm using, Pylance through the Python extension on VS Code, is perfectly happy with the completeness of my <code>match</code>-<code>case</code> constructions, so indeed they are guaranteed not to fail ever and so we don't get legally partial functions. </p>
<h3>List comprehension</h3>
<p>Another wonderful item in our toolbelt is Python list comprehensions! This is something I know about, but I never use, because I never think to use it, when I'm thinking about my algorithms. I think that's my loss, because it's so convenient and much more readable even than my <code>list(map(...))</code> habit.</p>
<p>There's another benefit to using list comprehensions, which is that there's no need to lambda new functions when they're not obvious: When I had functions <code>rescale_x()</code> and <code>rescale_y()</code>, mapping these functions onto a list was easy as pie, but now with a unified function <code>rescale()</code>, taking an <code>axis</code> parameter, list comprehensions make the code much simpler. Good habits beget good habits!</p>
