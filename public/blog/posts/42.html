        <p class="blog-post-date">2025-12-05</p>
        <p>I got my wish for a more difficult day! It's the first grid puzzle of the year. There was still room to get away with not doing anything smart, which is convenient because I'm a day behind! I'm definitely gonna come back and do something better.</p>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<p>To begin with, I store the grid in a variable, of type <code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;</code>. This is my first time using <code>std::vector</code>, but it's pretty intuitive at a high level, and I've not thought about the implementation too deeply, so to me it looks somewhat like a Python <code>list</code> which must be of one type only.</p>
<p>The grid is stored as a parameter <code>grid</code> in my own class, <code>RollGrid</code>, which I give a function to set its own parameters <code>rows</code> and <code>cols</code> based on itself. I then define a function <code>isRoll</code> within the class to find if a location (specified by <code>row</code> and <code>col</code>) is a roll (while returning <code>false</code> if the location is out of range). Thus, one last function <code>countAdjacentRolls</code> counts the rolls adjacent to a specified location on the grid.</p>
<p>Finally, we can loop through the grid, one at a time, to count how many rolls have less than 4 adjacent rolls.</p>
<h3>Part 2</h3>
<p>Here's the part for which my solution can be vastly improved. To do this part I basically run Part 1 over and over again: I edited my Part 1 solution to output a <code>std::set</code> of locations, which I can then count, and then use to edit the board (since strings are mutable in C++). Thus I can run this function over and over again to get the Part 2 answer.</p>
<h3>Possible improvements</h3>
<p>This solution is very inefficient because I run through the entire board every time, and count every adjacent roll every time as well, both things that can be optimized away. I'll do this another time, because I need to get on with Day 05 and more! If I do come back to this I'll add a note here.</p>
