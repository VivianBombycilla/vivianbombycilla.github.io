<h3>Tasks for the Rust Syndicate</h3>
<p>It's time now to do our bidding for the Rust Syndicate... </p>
<p>Our first task is to take care of some unwanted guests at a house... It sounds like we're gonna do some evil stuff, but as it turns out, the place just has some Ghost-type Pokemon who want a place to stay. We battle the Wild Gengars, and the requester decides that actually maybe the Gengar can stay around.</p>
<p>Corbeau arrives and congratulates us, and sends us over to an entrance to the Sewers, where we have to clear out Mega Clusters. Once we clean up, Corbeau appears again, and tells us that the "L" figure we've been seeing is named Lysandre (big surprise to those who've played Gen 6), and that this man helped out Corbeau when he was young. That's very sweet of him, and Lysandre seems more empathetic in this game than in the previous ones, but we'll still have to see. And why's Mable acting director of the Lab?</p>
<p>Anyways, our last task is to shoo away some annoying Trainers from the SBC, who are harassing the little kids at the battle court. We teach them a lesson about unwanted advice by defeating them, with the cherring support of the kids. Finally, Corbeau comes and compliments us on our abilities, and invites us back to the Rust Syndicate headquarters for a final chat.</p>
<h3>Reaching Rank C</h3>
<p>Up at his office once again, we have a nice chat and Corbeau declares that he wants to have a Pokemon Battle! In fact, our Rotom Phone gives us our next Promotion Match: The very same Corbeau. Is something shady going on? Maybe, but at least we can rank up now.</p>
<p>We even have our Challenger's Ticket, so we don't even have to leave the office. The battle against Corbeau is simple enough, and we get to see Mega Scolipede! Fiona keeps taking these Rock Slides from Pokemon it otherwise has a type advantage against, I guess that's just what to except against physical Fighting and Posion types... Scolipede is also strong against Arthur, but Pepper's very strong defensively so that's who took down Corbeau's ace.</p>

<h3>MEGA SCRAFTYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</h3>
<p>At Hotel Z once again, Lida, Naveen, and Urbain convene with us about the Rust Syndicate debt and the jobs we're having to take on. Then, all of a sudden: Corbeau rings the door at the hotel! He comes in, and asks for a room! The next day, he leaves a tip that's exactly the debt owed, and conveniently the debt collector arrives and Urbain's able to repay it in full. So, that's that sorted, even if it was really scary and shady the whole way through!</p>
<p>AZ gives Naveen and Lida each a Mega Ring, since they've been so helpful with the Rogue Megas. That means Lida will be able to Mega Evolve a Starmie, and Naveen will be able to Mega Evolve... SCRAFTY!!!!!! YEAHHHHH</p>
<p>I actually didn't know there was Mega Scrafty until now! I've stayed unspoiled until now! And I'm soooo happy :))</p>
<p>We go outside and fight Lida, who hasn't evolved her Staryu quite yet, as well as Naveen, who Mega Evolves Scrafty and it looks sooo cool and I can't wait to have my own!!! Quasartico, please get on it!!!</p>
<p>Finally, at the Cafe Nouveau, we're visited by a uniquely dressed individual from the SBC&lt; who invites us over. Lida insists we dress up, so we're supposed to go to the fancy Boutique Couture to dress up.</p>
