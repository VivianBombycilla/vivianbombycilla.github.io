        <h3>Rising the Ranks</h3>
<p>Now that we've done a whopping three Side Missions, we go back to the Looker Bureau and talk to Emma. She shows us Mega Evolution, by Mega Evolving her Ampharos. Máire, that's gonna be you one day!!!</p>
<p>Once that's done, we get our next Promotion Match opponent, Yvon, and it suddenly becomes nighttime! We quickly defeat a few trainers, collect our Challenger's Ticket and find Yvon in Bleu Plaza. She's not much of a challenge, but it's still nice to be making progress :)</p>

<p>Once we're promoted, the night ends right away, and we get sent into a new day. Now's probably a good time to crack on with some mission clearing! We battle a few trainers, show a few others some specific Pokemon they're asking for (such as Ekans or the Pantrio), and help an ailing Fennekin, who joins our party (which is so cool!). My absolute highlight of the day came from Mission 014: Slurpuff's Café Visit, where we have to escort a REALLY CUTE Slurpuff to the café because it's GRUMPY!!! And it wants MACARONS!!! So relatable!!!</p>
<p>The sun fades and it's once again time for the Battle Zone. We run around, picking up cards and sneaking up on trainers, and soon enough we get enough points for a Challenger's Ticket! I'm finding Fiona's really good at sneaking up on our opponents quickly, while Máire can shock Pokemon through obstacles! The battle system is pretty cool too, and I do wonder how much skill expression can be wrought from it, given that attacks may miss the target: I've found Fiona has been dodging a few Rock Tombs, but I'm not sure how to do this intentionally, or even if that's possible.</p>
<p>Finally, we visit the Académie Étoile to fight our opponent, Xavi, in a Promotion Match! This kid loves the letter X, so we do him a favour and let him stay there :)</p>

<h3>Clearing Out the Missions (Except One)</h3>
<p>When we left Emma's, we got 18 more missions on top of the three we already cleared. Let's try and clear them all! We have to battle some more Trainers: One duo who's debating Poison vs Paralysis, one super cute Audino, one long-range expert. Then there was Chespin, who we had to battle over and over again, before it finally decided to join us!</p>
<p>We became a parkour pro to impress Froakie, we participated in the super cute Budew show, and we locate all 13 Spewpa in the Museum. We find a shiny Mareep on the rooftop, yay! We even get a call from Mable, who gives us a choice of Gen 1 starter! Bulbasaur was our pick :) </p>
<p>There's just one mission that I got stuck on: Mission 012: The Many Flowers of Flabébé. Where am I supposed to find Orange or Blue Flabébé???</p>
<p>Oh well. The sun goes down, we Battle in the Zone, and we collect a good payout for the night. next time, I'll rank up to Rank V and progress the story. The Flabébé will come with time.</p>
